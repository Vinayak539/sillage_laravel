  <h2>Cancellation of transaction / orders</h2>
  <ul class="dasimalBuilatitem">
  <li>
  <p class="OneBox1"><strong>Cancellation by Seller:</strong> There may be certain orders that Seller is unable to accept and has the right to cancel either by the Seller directly or Seller can instruct Sillage to cancel such order. Seller reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason whatsoever. Some situations that may result in Buyer's order being cancelled include, without limitation, non-availability of the Product or quantities ordered by Buyer or inaccuracies or errors in pricing information. Seller may also require additional verifications or information before processing any order. All such cancellation shall be without any recourse to Buyer and without any liability to the Seller or to Sillage. If Buyer's order is so cancelled, after the payment has been processed, the said amount will be reversed / remitted to the Buyer either to the bank account provided by the Buyer for such reversal, or to the payment instrument of the Buyer from which payment was made, or to any pre-paid payment instrument account of the Buyer. Sillage shall have the sole discretion to determine the mode of reversal from the above options. In the event a promotional code given by Sillage is used for the purchase of the Product, the amount under such promotional code shall not be refunded in case of cancellation of order. The above is the sole remedy of the Buyer and the sole liability of the Seller and sole responsibility of Sillage for any cancellation of the purchase order by the Seller or otherwise other than by the Buyer.</p></li>
  <li><p class="OneBox">6.2</p>
  <p class="OneBox1"><strong>Cancellation by the Buyer:</strong>  In case of requests for order cancellations, Seller reserves the right to accept or reject requests for order cancellations for any reason whatsoever. As part of usual business practice, if Seller receives a cancellation notice and the order has not been processed, Seller may cancel the order and refund the entire amount to Buyer within a reasonable period of time. Seller will not be able to cancel orders that have already been processed by the Seller. Buyer agrees not to dispute the decision made by Seller and accept Seller's decision regarding the cancellation.</p></li>
  <li><p class="OneBox">6.3</p>
  <p class="OneBox1"><strong>Set-off of any benefits availed by the Buyer:</strong>  In case the Buyer has availed any benefit under any marketing or promotions provided by Sillage in relation to the Product for which the order has been cancelled by the Buyer or by the Seller, Buyer agrees and authorizes Snapedal to recover such benefits from the Buyer or set-off the same from any refunds to the Buyer.</p></li>
